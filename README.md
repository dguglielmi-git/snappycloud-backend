# Snappy Cloud :: (Backend)
![Logo](./Logo.png)
Snappy is a business application developed for managing retail businesses. This repository only contains the code of the backend.
Once the projects are progressing, we will be sharing the links of the rest of the repositories.

Snappy is free and will always be this way. It's intended to be used by business owners who require a free, efficient and scalable solution for their businesses. 

Snappy Architecture combines several technologies, and it is divided in different projects:
* [Snappy Cloud Backend](#) - (Kotlin) - The backend handle all interactions with the database and contains all the business logic.
* [Snappy FrontEnd](#) - (React JS) - It allows business owners to manage their business with their branches offices, handle CRUD of users, roles, permissions, reports (sales, purchases, finances, Inventory), products, materials, carriers, clients, and more... 
* [Snappy Standalone App](#) - (ElectronJS) - It is used by the operational level of the organization: seller, supervisors, and every user role that needs to do operational tasks.
* [Snappy Mobile App](#) - (React Native)

*Notes: The [Snappy Standalone Application](#) is being migrated from its old version written in Java. It is currently deprecated and no more available for downloading.
